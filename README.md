#### Do not contact mod authors directly for support.

All support must be directed to the relevant discussion channel on the Wabbajack Discord.  
Pirated games and mods are not supported

## Requirements before installing

- Current build version of Wabbajack. This can be found on the Wabbajack Discord linked above.
- Clean install of Dragon Age: Inquisition, with all DLCs, Non-negotiable. (I use the Steam Version, so experience on the Origin version may vary)
- A Nexusmods account. Premium is highly recommended for automatic download support.
- 500Mb of spave. Yes, you read that right.

## Game Preparations

Once Dragon Age Inquisition is installed, make sure you run it once. (Get to the main menu, and exit).

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the latest version of Wabbajack.
2. Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: D:\Wabbajack).
3. Place the Wabbajack.exe into this new folder.
4. Launch Wabbajack.exe
5. Click 'Browse Modlists'
6. Locate Ferelden Universal Comprehensive Catastrophe and click the 'Download Modlist' button
7. In “Installation Location” choose a blank folder at the root of a drive (example: D:\FUCC). This location CANNOT be where you have the Wabbajack.exe located.
8. The "Download Location" will update automatically. You can change it if you wish.
9. Click the "Play" arrow.
10. Make sure to accept the Nexus API request if your browser asks for it.
11. When Wabbajack completes the installation (you can check the Wabbajack.exe.log to confirm it completed successfully), you may close the program.
12. Open your install folder, and then 'FMM Config File' folder, and move the FrostyModManager DragonAgeInquisition.ini file to the Frosty Mod Manager folder. Make sure to open the config file with your text editor of choice, and change the path to wherever your game is installed.

**That’s almost it!** Launch Frosty Mod Manager from the 'Frosty Mod Manager' folder, then click 'Launch'. If you see any prompts asking for admin access, make sure to click 'Yes' or the mods won't work!
From now on, launch the game through Frosty Mod Manager. <br>

**DISCLAIMER**
This list is designed around playing the 'Nightmare' difficulty. You can play it easier, but things will most likely not function as intended. You are also free to add cosmetic mods as you wish at the end of your load order in Frosty Mod Manager, but there is no guarantee that the list will function correctly, and no support will be provided if you do so.

A MASSIVE thanks to everyone who supports me on Patreon, Halgari and the Wabbajack team for creating this wonderful too, and everyone who plays and enjoys my lists!
